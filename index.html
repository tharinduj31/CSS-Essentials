    <p class="highlight-content">For millennia brewers have taken hops, grain, yeast and water and turned them into
      flavours unique to their own place and time. Each beer - some rough and some refined - captured the essence of a
      moment. We love to share these moments with our guests.</p>

    <p>Cumberland has always been a community on the fringes, a place where independent thinkers could come for a
      fresh start and to build something of their own. Today it's tree planters and oil patch workers, outdoor
      enthusiasts, activists, young families, creatives, retirees, and tireless trail builders. At the end of the day
      these disparate folks eat, drink and come together. Growing a community is thirsty work.

    <p>Cumberland deserves good beer that's a reward for the daily toil of continuing to build a community. Real beer.
