          Cumberland Brewing Company was created with the desire to share a beer
          in a place that would be inclusive and inviting to everyone in our
          community. We believed if we constructed a space where we wanted to
          share a beer, others would also enjoy it. Good ideas start here, bad
          ideas end here, and everything in-between.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mandate has always been to make great beer, great food, and a
          welcoming space for our guests. This in turn creates good jobs in our
          little Village, and a tight circular economy that is also sustainable.

      <h2>Riders Pizza</h2>
      <p>
        In October 2011 Michael and Caroline Tymchuk started Riders Pizza, and
        it slowly became a foothold in the community. When the brewery was built
        beside Riders Pizza in 2014, our first thought was to offer pizza to our
        customers, so we cut a hole in the wall and did just that. But the
        little pizza shop couldn't handle the increased customer base and moved
        across the street to a larger location. You can no longer get pizza at
        the Brewery, but you can get CBC beer at Riders Pizza! On Feb 2, 2016,
        CBC created its own kitchen, and it continues to create interesting,
        quality-made food.
      </p>
      <p>
        Michael's career in Food and Beverage started early in life. His first
        efforts were in the kitchen, but 2 years into working at Canada's first
        “In-House” brewpub (Spinnakers in Victoria), he was asked if he had any
        interest in learning to brew. The rest is history. In the following 30+
        years Michael has brewed, taught brewers, assembled new systems all over
        the world, and started a family. After many successful endeavors in the
        industry Michael and Caroline started Riders Pizza in Cumberland.
        Opening a brewery was always on their mind - they were just waiting for
        the right people to come along.

      <h2>A fruitful partnership</h2>
      <p>
        In early 2013 Darren Adam and Michelle Forslund met the Tymchuks for the
        first time while enjoying their pizza. When Darren heard of Michael's
        experience and history, he hatched a plan to convince his new friends to
        partner in a Brewery for Cumberland. It took a little longer than
        planned for Darren to sell himself to the Tymchuks, but in the end, he
        was able to (con)vince them.

      <p>
        The business model at CBC is described as a “Community Brewery.”
        Decisions and ideas are proposed based on the concept that it
        contributes positively to the community. No distribution outside of
        Cumberland, and no bottling or canning. We believe that beer tastes best
        right at any brewery, and that is why we say, “If you want our beer,
        come here.”
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to acknowledge the amazing support that we have always received
        from our “Peers in Beer.” Every brewery that we have ever contacted with
        questions or issues has always been helpful and supportive. We are happy
        to do the same. The craft beer industry is full of talented
        community-minded people and we feel so lucky to be a part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have experienced our brewery, thank you for coming. If you have
        not, you really do owe it to yourself.
      </p>
      <p>We look forward to seeing you soon.</p>
