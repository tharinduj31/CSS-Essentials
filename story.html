      <p>Cumberland Brewing Company was created with the desire to share a beer in a place that would be inclusive and
        inviting to everyone in our community. We believed if we constructed a space where we wanted to share a beer,
        others would also enjoy it. Good ideas start here, bad ideas end here, and everything in-between.</p>
      <p>Our mandate
        has always been to make great beer, great food, and a welcoming space for our guests. This in turn creates good
        jobs in our little Village, and a tight circular economy that is also sustainable.</p>

    <h2>Riders Pizza</h2>
    <p>In October 2011 Michael and Caroline Tymchuk started Riders Pizza, and it slowly became a foothold in the
      community. When the brewery was built beside Riders Pizza in 2014, our first thought was to offer pizza to our
      customers, so we cut a hole in the wall and did just that. But the little pizza shop couldn't handle the
      increased customer base and moved across the street to a larger location. You can no longer get pizza at the
      Brewery, but you can get CBC beer at Riders Pizza! On Feb 2, 2016, CBC created its own kitchen, and it continues
      to create interesting, quality-made food.</p>
    <p>Michael's career in Food and Beverage started early in life. His first efforts were in the kitchen, but 2 years
      into working at Canada's first “In-House” brewpub (Spinnakers in Victoria), he was asked if he had any interest
      in learning to brew. The rest is history. In the following 30+ years Michael has brewed, taught brewers,
      assembled new systems all over the world, and started a family. After many successful endeavors in the industry
      Michael and Caroline started Riders Pizza in Cumberland. Opening a brewery was always on their mind - they were
      just waiting for the right people to come along.</p>

    <h2>A fruitful partnership</h2>
    <p>In early 2013 Darren Adam and Michelle Forslund met the Tymchuks for the first time while enjoying their pizza.
      When Darren heard of Michael's experience and history, he hatched a plan to convince his new friends to partner
      in a Brewery for Cumberland. It took a little longer than planned for Darren to sell himself to the Tymchuks,
      but in the end, he was able to (con)vince them.</p>
    <p>The business model at CBC is described as a “Community Brewery.” Decisions and ideas are proposed based on the
      concept that it contributes positively to the community. No distribution outside of Cumberland, and no bottling
      or canning. We believe that beer tastes best right at any brewery, and that is why we say, “If you want our
      beer, come here.”</p>
    <p>We want to acknowledge the amazing support that we have always received from our “Peers in Beer.” Every brewery
      that we have ever contacted with questions or issues has always been helpful and supportive. We are happy to do
      the same. The craft beer industry is full of talented community-minded people and we feel so lucky to be a part
      of it.</p>
    <p>If you have experienced our brewery, thank you for coming. If you have not, you really do owe it to yourself.
    </p>
    <p>We look forward to seeing you soon.</p>
